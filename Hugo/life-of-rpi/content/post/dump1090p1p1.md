Some updates from [yesterday's post](/2016/09/22/dump1090p1/ "Dump1090 Part1") 
are in order.

It turns out that as of July of 2016, Google no longer allows unlimited
use of the mapping API without a key, which affects `Dump1090`'s ability
to show maps (google 
[Dump1090 google maps](https://www.google.com/webhp?sourceid=chrome-instant&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8#q=dump1090+google+maps "Dump1090 google maps") 
for details. For whatever reason, I didn't see this problem on my Raspberry PI
the first time I ran Dump1090, but on subsequent runs, I no longer saw the 
map displayed in the graphical web output.

Now the real solution to update to the 
[mutability version](https://github.com/mutability/dump1090 "Mutability Dump1090") 
of `Dump1090`, but since that version requires some more work with respect
to setting up a proper webserver, I decided for a quick fix.

The solution is to get your own API Key for Google maps, which can be done
[here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key "Get Maps API Key")

Once this is done, the following line in the `public_html/gmap.html` file
of the downloaded `Dump1090` sources needs to be updated (insert the proper
key instead of the x's)

```
<script type="text/javascript" src="//maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?key=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx&libraries=geometry"></script>
```

The tail end of the updated `Dockerfile` for `Dump1090` then looks like this 
(requires a properly edited `gmap.html` in the same directory as the `Dockerfile`)

```
...
WORKDIR /data
RUN cp ./rtl-sdr/rtl-sdr.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/
RUN git clone git://github.com/MalcolmRobb/dump1090.git

WORKDIR /data/dump1090
COPY gmap.html /data/dump1090/public_html/gmap.html
RUN make

EXPOSE 8080

ENTRYPOINT ["/data/dump1090/dump1090", "--net"]
```

With this change, `Dump1090` graphical output works when 
viewed in a webbrowser.
