+++

This blog, besides being my first effort at publishing something online, is 
meant to be a repository of all the fun things I learn about and do with the
Raspberry PI. 

I first learned about Raspberry PI's last year, which coincided with me getting my feet
wet again with Linux, having abandoned it in the early 2000's and being a Mac person
for many years. At this point I am on my 4th's Raspberry PI. A lot of what I learned
about these tiny but powerful computers comes from people's blogs where they describe
how they try things, so this blog is my attempt of giving back and sharing what I know.

If you find anything on this blog useful, I'd love to hear from you. And if you you
are curious about my day job, check me out [here](http://nikolaischlegel.com
